            <h5 class="title">Round 1:</h5>
            <p class="description">The first round “Code-a-Bit” which will be initiated by a competitive contest conducted solely to assesed the basic coding skills of the participants. They are given a set of real world problems with a time limit and are asked to code a solution for it.  We will make use of the HackerRank platform here to enable the coding and judging scenario. We are looking at judging their basic analytic skills and understanding of coding concepts here. It will be an elimination round where only the top candidates will be eligible for the next round (for which a cut off will be decided depending on number of students who register)</p>
            <h5 class="title">Round 2:</h5>
            <p class="description">The second phase of this event is “Open Brackets”, where the participants will undergo challenges of a higher caliber based again on real world scenarios. They are expected to possess a good knowledge of data structure, algorithm, design and development. Keep in mind that efficiency and time management are some of the traits candidates need to advance to the next round. This round will also be conducted on HackerRank and finally the 10 best teams will be selected to go to the final hackathon round.</p>
            <h5 class="title">Round 3:</h5>
            <p class="description">“The Hackathon” is the final round where the real battle of wits takes place. It is a 20 hr long booster round where the participants are expected to code with exorbitant zeal. They will have to choose a particular topic from a set of topics. The catalogue of topics will be announced as and when the finalist is announced and thus begins the round. They are supposed to come up with an idea to execute as an application (Web, iOS or Android). They have to generate a clear cut report on the same with very specific details such as target description and give scenarios for implementation. They also have to write the code for the same and show a demo. Our judges from the industry will expect them to explain their idea and also sell it to them in terms of a start-up. The top 3 teams will be judged the winners.</p>
